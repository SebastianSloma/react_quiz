# About App

This is a continuation of the [Python Knowledge Quiz App](https://github.com/SebastianSloma/Quiz-app), which has been done before in Flask using Python. Now written in React using JavaScript and decorated with Tailwind. This is a programming language knowledge quiz app with categories, storing questions in an array, single-choice questions. Each quiz consists of 5 questions of different levels of difficulty, which are selected at random. When the quiz is completed, the percentage of correct answers is displayed, and the app is easy to use and has an attractive interface.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
